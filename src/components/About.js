                <h3>The list of 4 best successful failures is mentioned with the help of the following bullet points:</h3>
                <br/><h4>Steve Jobs:</h4>
                <h5>
                Steve Jobs has been known as an iconic figure for the establishment of Apple °
                like the biggest company. However, it is extremely shocking to know that the $2 
                billion company with over 4000 employees has been started with only two persons 
                in a garage. It is also to be noticed that this great establisher has been dismissed
                 and fired from the company from which he has started his career. Further, 
                 realizing his potential and capabilities, Steve Jobs proceeded further towards 
                 establishing this biggest company which is famously known as ‘Apple’.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                <h4>Bill Gates:</h4> It was very much important for Bill gates to heed the lessons of 
                failure in comparison to celebrating the joy of success. This great entrepreneur
                 who has established Microsoft like the biggest software company is a dropout student
                  from Harvard. Furthermore, he has also been known for his self-owned business figure
                   known as    Traf-O-Data which was one of the biggest failures in history. The entire
                    investment of Bill Gates got vanished and unfortunately, even the education could 
                    also not get completed. But, the keen desire and the passion for the computer 
                    programming based stuff led him to establish such biggest software company with 
                    the brand name ‘Microsoft’
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                    <h4>Albert Einstein:</h4> 
                    Albert Einstein is a well-known scientist and extraordinary genius 
                    personality known by almost all of us all over the world due to his 
                    great inventions and contributions towards science. He quoted that 
                    success is a failure in progress and someone who has never failed cannot 
                    truly be a successful person. During childhood, he suffered from continuous 
                    failures. He was not even able to speak fluently till the age of nine years 
                    following which he has been expelled from the school. Furthermore, his admission 
                    to Zurich Polytechnic School was also not considered. But, leading to the ways of
                     success consistently, he proved himself as a renowned gem in the ocean of science
                      and technology and finally won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.

                        <h5>
                        <h4>Abraham Lincoln:</h4>
                            This great personality who has also been the ex-president of the 
                            USA has suffered regularly from massive failures year after the year. 
                            Lincoln failed in his business in the year 1831 and after which in 
                            the year 1836, he got a major nervous breakdown. Struggling 
                            consistently for years, he again failed in 1856 during US
                             presidential elections. Fighting and struggling consistently, 
                             he elected as the sixteenth President of the USA in 1861 and went 
                             on leading towards his way of life.
